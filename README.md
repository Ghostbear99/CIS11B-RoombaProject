# CIS11B-RoombaProject
Control Roomba Create via Arduino Uno

The Roomba will follow a coded path to a box. If it is not close enough to the box it will use its sensor on the arm and it will continue driving until it detects the prescense of a box in the determined range in the code. It will then scan the RFID tag on the box and if the ID is correct than it will proceed. It will then use its sensor and its arm to pick the object up. The Roomba will then drive back to the orignal starting point and drop the object.
